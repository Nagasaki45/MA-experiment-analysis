Experiment analysis
===================

Experiment design - Just for reference...

## Analysis notebooks

- [Video analysis notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Nagasaki45/MA-experiment-analysis/blob/master/analyze.ipynb). Contains the movement, "sitting on the bench", distance from beacons, and clustering analysis.

- In addition to the main video analysis notebook above, there are two extra notebooks dealing with video data. The first is the [video data mangling notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Nagasaki45/MA-experiment-analysis/blob/master/video_data_mangling.ipynb), where the raw data passed some validations, affine transformation, clipping, etc.. The second is the [animations preview notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Nagasaki45/MA-experiment-analysis/blob/master/animations.ipynb).

- [System satisfaction survey (SUS based) analysis](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Nagasaki45/MA-experiment-analysis/blob/master/usability.ipynb).

- [Social interaction survey analysis](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Nagasaki45/MA-experiment-analysis/blob/master/interaction_surveys.ipynb). WIP, 2-way repeated measure anova is needed.

- [Participants familiarity analysis](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Nagasaki45/MA-experiment-analysis/blob/master/familiarity.ipynb). Originally, tried to cluster the participants into socially cohisive subgroups. It seems that such clustering can not be achived...

## Analysis notes

- [Good SPSS two way repeated measure anova instructions](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/nursing/Documents/PDF/RepeatedMeasuresANOVA.pdf).

- The `scripts` dir is the place to put external scripts to the analysis notebooks. For SPSS interaction / data transformation for example.

## More info

- Information about the experiment, analysis methods and more could be find in my [research proposal](https://db.tt/4h5u179a).

- Additional details about the research may olso be found at [my blog](http://tomgurion.blogspot.co.il/p/master-thesis.html).
